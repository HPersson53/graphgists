You create a GraphGist by creating a https://gist.github.com/[GitHub Gist] in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] and enter the URL to it in the form on this page.
Alternatively, you can put an AsciiDoc document in https://www.dropbox.com/[Dropbox] and enter the public URL in the form.

This GraphGist shows the basics of using AsciiDoc syntax and a few additions for GraphGists.
The additions are entered as comments on their own line.
They are:  +//console+ for a query console; +//hide+, +//setup+ and +//output+ to configure a query; +//graph+ and +//table+ to visualize queries and show a result table.

Click on the Page Source button in the menu to see the source for this GraphGist.
Read below to get the full details.

== Define a http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher] query

 [source,cypher]
 ----
 MATCH (who:Person {name:'Me'})-[likes:LIKES]->(what)
 RETURN who,likes,what
 ----

becomes:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (who:Person {name:'Me'})-[likes:LIKES]->(what)
RETURN who,likes,what
----

_Queries are executed in the order they appear on the page during rendering, so make sure they can be performed in that order._
Each query has a green or red button to indicate if the query was successful or not.
The console is set up after the executions, with an empty database, for the reader to play around with the queries.

There's three additional settings you can use for queries.
They all go as comments, on their own lines, before the query.
The settings are:

[width="50%",cols="1m,5"]
|===
| hide | Hide the query. The reader can still expand it to see it.
  Useful for long queries like setting up initial data.
| setup | Initialize the console with this query.
| output | Show the output from the query.
  The output is always there, but this option makes it visible at page load for this query.
|===

Let's try all the settings together, which means this query will be used to initialize the console, it will be hidden, and the raw output will be shown:

 //hide
 //setup
 //output
 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (me:Person {name:'Me'})-[r:LIKES]->(neo4j:Database:Graph:NoSQL {name:'Neo4j'})
 RETURN me.name, r, neo4j
 ----

which becomes:

//hide
//setup
//output
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (me:Person {name:'Me'})-[r:LIKES]->(neo4j:Database:Graph:NoSQL {name:'Neo4j'})
RETURN me.name, r, neo4j
----


== Show a graph visualization

The visualization is based on the **database contents** after the preceding query in the page.

+//graph+

becomes:

//graph


== Show a graph visualization

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (who:Person {name:'Me'})-[likes:LIKES]->(what)
RETURN who,likes,what
----

The visualisation is based on the **results** returned by the preceding query in the page.

+//graph_result+

becomes:

//graph_result

== Show a result table for a query

This will show a result table for the preceding query.

+//table+

becomes:

//table

== Query with error ==

This is what happens if a query causes an error:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n:QueryLanguage {name:'cypher'}
----

== Include a query console

A console button will be included anyway to hide or show the console. 
This will place the cypher-console where you want it and open it by default.

+//console+

becomes:

//console

== Basic AsciiDoc formatting

[width="50%",cols="1m,1a"]

Tables are well supported.
