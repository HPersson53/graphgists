Reference Graph Gists

== Basic Guidelines for Graph Gists

* Use neo4j-version: 2.2
* Use Neo4j 2.2 features, especially **Labels**
* Adhere to the Cypher style guide (capitalized labels, all-caps rel-types, camel-case properties, if possible consistent keyword casing e.g. all-caps)
* Use meaningful relationship types
* Include a data model between 20 and 150 nodes in size
* Explain the use case and be good read but not a novel
* Include a good domain picture, if possible other illustrating pictures
* Include meta-information about the author and topics
* Use the graphgist tools (//graph_result, //table, //setup, //hide, //output)
* Hide long long setup queries
* Use one line per sentence for easier versioning
* End with //console at the end


== Basic Guidelines for Blog Posts

In order to maximize the impact of the graph gists, we should write and update them with future blog posts in mind. 

* Posts should be 500+ words
* Posts should include at least one picture or graphic (more are always welcome)
* Posts should include at least one code example
