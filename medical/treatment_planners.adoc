== Domain

A key aspect of treatment in the field of behavioral health involves creating a treatment plan.
Primarily a plan consists of four parts, Problem, Goal, Objective, and Intervention.

The Problem states, in general terms, what the patient is suffering with.
This might be Depression, Low self-Esteem, Substance Abuse.
The Goal is the end result.
Example "Demonstrate respect and regard for self and others"
Objectives are steps along the way, ways in which the patient is going to improve.

Interventions are tasks or activities performed as part of the plan. These may be things the patient does.
Or it maybe others involved in the treatment.

I am using the "Wiley treatment plan" data set as the model since it is one standard that is used in BH.

Plans come packaged as libraries.
Problems have goals, objectives and interventions.
I have left diagnosis and descriptions out since they are informational.
In using the data set one first selects a library and then a problem.
The options for goals, objectives or interventions are based on the library and problem selected.
There are several deviations from this that make implementation difficult.

The first is a special linkage from problem to goal to intervention.
This says only allow interventions related to a specific problem and goal.

The second change is that not everyone uses the plan in this defined order(problem-> [goal,objective,intervention]).
A system has to let the user start from any point and work from there.
The user can start with goal then jump to intervention and then on to problem.
I don't claim to understand why they want to do this, its a requirement.

Thirdly, the information(goals, objectives, interventions) is reused.
GoalA maybe used for ProblemA in LibraryA but it maybe used again with other problems within the same library or span libraries.

Setting this up in an SQL database required a separate table to maintain "linkages" for each plan.
Searching requires traversing the linkage table a number of times.
The result are queries that can run from two to ten seconds depending on how many libraries are loaded.

Implementing this in Neo4 resulted in 300 nodes and 120k relationships.
A typical query runs in about 500 ms and
RETURNs 500-700 values.
Adding custom plans that deviate from the Wiley plan is easy and doesn't affect the performance.

===  Data Model

The sample data set uses a one library, one problem, and four objectives, goals, and interventions.

== Conclusion
Developing the treatment planner in SQL took months to get correct and the performance to the point where it was useable.
I used py2neo to populate import the data in to the graph.
In all, it took less than a week from start to finish(it took longer to create this gist).
